# Web Client on Linux — Proof of Concept

**Status: WORKING — intended as a dev convenience tool** (spin up a
container on Linux/macOS and do basic testing through the browser UI), not
a production deployment target. Microsoft's real Business Central web client
(`Prod.Client.WebCoreApp`, ASP.NET Core / .NET 8) runs self-hosted on Kestrel
inside the bc container, pointed at the Linux NST, and is fully usable from a
real browser: sign-in, role center with live CRONUS data, list pages, and
cards all render and respond. No protocol shim, no emulation — this is the
unmodified web server binary from the BC platform artifact, runtime-patched
the same way the NST is.

Verified on BC 28.1 (platform 28.0.51325.0) with headless Chromium via
Playwright:

| Milestone | Screenshot |
|---|---|
| (a) Sign-in page renders | ![sign-in](webclient-poc/01-signin.png) |
| (b)+(c) Login (BCRUNNER) + role center with live Activities tiles | ![role center](webclient-poc/02-rolecenter.png) |
| (d) Customer List with real CRONUS rows + FactBox | ![customer list](webclient-poc/03-customer-list.png) |
| (e) Customer Card with real field values | ![customer card](webclient-poc/04-customer-card.png) |

## How to run

```bash
BC_WEBCLIENT=1 docker compose up -d --wait
# then browse to http://localhost:8080  (BCRUNNER / Admin123!)
```

Or start it manually inside a running container:

```bash
docker compose exec -d bc /bc/scripts/start-webclient.sh
docker compose exec bc tail -f /tmp/webclient.log
```

The host port is `${BC_WEBCLIENT_PORT:-8080}`. Everything is additive and
opt-in: with `BC_WEBCLIENT` unset, nothing about the NST boot path changes.

Settings can go in `.env` instead of the command line — for the Entra and
Traefik setup below they have to, since a bare `docker compose up -d` that
omits them recreates bc without them.

When `BC_WEBCLIENT=1`, the entrypoint also sets the NST's `PublicWebBaseUrl`
to `http://localhost:${BC_WEBCLIENT_PORT:-8080}/` (override with
`BC_WEBCLIENT_PUBLIC_URL` when the host-published port differs, e.g. parallel
instances). This is what the dev endpoint's `webEndpoint` field advertises —
the AL debugger's launch mode (F5) uses it to open the browser at the right
URL with the `debuggingcontext` parameter (see `docs/DEBUGGING.md`). Note the
AL extension caches this in `ServerInfoCache.dat` next to its host binary; if
F5 keeps opening a port-less `http://localhost/?page=...` URL after enabling
the web client on an existing setup, delete that file (or restart VS Code's
AL services) to force a re-read.

### Path-prefix reverse proxying

Set `BC_WEBCLIENT_PATHBASE` (e.g. `/my-tier`) when a reverse proxy in front
of the container routes by path on a single shared hostname/port instead of
by hostname or port — the case where adding a hostname or a port per tier
isn't an option:

```bash
BC_WEBCLIENT=1 BC_WEBCLIENT_PATHBASE=/my-tier docker compose up -d --wait
```

`start-webclient.sh` appends the prefix to the URL it writes into
`hosting.json`. `HttpSysStub`'s `UrlStrippingStartupFilter` (shared with the
NST) already strips path components off server addresses that Kestrel can't
bind directly and calls `UsePathBase()` with the stripped path, so BC's own
middleware — redirects (`Location: /SignIn?...`), asset URLs, `ReturnUrl` —
routes correctly under the prefix without any further configuration. The
entrypoint reuses the same prefix for `PublicWebBaseUrl` so the AL debugger's
F5 launch URL matches. Leave it unset for the default root-path setup; it
has no effect on the NST or on `BC_WEBCLIENT=0`.

### TLS terminated by the proxy

Set `BC_WEBCLIENT_REQUIRE_SSL=1` when that reverse proxy also terminates TLS.
The web client speaks plain HTTP and builds its redirects from its own scheme,
so without it the sign-in redirect comes back as
`Location: http://<public-host>:<port>/SignIn?...`. The browser then follows
that in cleartext against a TLS-only port and the request is reset
(`ERR_CONNECTION_RESET`). The flag flips `RequireSsl` in `navsettings.json`, so
BC emits `https://` and marks its session cookies `Secure`. It does not change
how the client reaches the NST - that hop stays plain `ws://localhost:7085`
(`ServerHttps` is unaffected). Leave it unset for direct `http://localhost`
access.

```bash
BC_WEBCLIENT=1 BC_WEBCLIENT_PATHBASE=/my-tier BC_WEBCLIENT_REQUIRE_SSL=1 \
  docker compose up -d --wait
```

## Entra ID sign-in

Working, and the split is the whole trick: **the NST stays on
`NavUserPassword`; only the web client is `AccessControlService`.** Moving the
tier to `AccessControlService` breaks the container healthcheck (it does basic
auth against OData) and the AL toolkit publish (HTTP 401). The web client
validates the Entra token itself, then opens its client-services session over
7085 exactly as before — `ClientServicesUserNamePasswordValidator` on the tier
delegates to `WSFederationValidator`, so NavUserPassword and Entra are not the
alternatives they look like.

Everything lives in `.env`; `docker compose --profile traefik up -d` needs no
command-line variables:

```bash
BC_WEBCLIENT=1
BC_AAD_APP_ID=<app id>
BC_AAD_TENANT_ID=<tenant id>
BC_AAD_USER_UPN=<the token's email claim>
BC_WEBCLIENT_PUBLIC_URL=https://<host>:<port>/
BC_WEBCLIENT_PUBLIC_HOST=<host>:<port>
BC_WEBCLIENT_HOST_PORT=8081          # bc moves off 8080 so Traefik can take it
BC_WEBCLIENT_HTTPS_PFX=/certs/bc.pfx
BC_WEBCLIENT_HTTPS_PFX_PASSWORD=<pfx password>
BC_WEBCLIENT_FORWARDED_HEADERS=0     # Traefik re-originates TLS instead
```

### Pitfalls, each of which cost a debugging cycle

- **`BC_AAD_USER_UPN` is the token's `email` claim, not the directory UPN.**
  A personal Microsoft account federated into the tenant signs in with
  `idp: live.com`, and its token carries `email=user@gmail.com` while the
  directory UPN is `user@tenant.onmicrosoft.com`. BC matches the token to a
  row in `[User]` by `[Authentication Email]`, so the directory UPN silently
  matches nothing. Symptom: sign-in completes at Microsoft and BC still
  rejects you.
- **Only one BC user may carry a given `[Authentication Email]`.** The
  entrypoint derives the user name from the local part of
  `BC_AAD_USER_UPN` (`user@gmail.com` → `USER`) and guards on
  `IF NOT EXISTS ([User Name])`, not on the email — so a second hand-made row
  with the same email collides. Leave `[Authentication Object ID]` empty; BC
  writes it on first successful sign-in.
- **`ADOpenIdMetadataLocation` must be set.** Empty produces the opaque
  "You cannot sign in due to a technical issue" page after a successful
  Microsoft round-trip.
- **`PublicWebBaseUrl` must include the port.** BC derives both the OAuth
  redirect URI and the WebSocket allowed-origin list from it. A port-less
  value 403s every `/csh` upgrade.
- **DataProtection keys are not persisted.** Any `bc` recreate invalidates
  auth and antiforgery cookies — sign in again.

### What devtunnel does to your headers

The relay rewrites **both `Host` and `Origin`** to `localhost:<port>`,
regardless of `--host-header unchanged` and `--origin-header unchanged`.
Measured, sending `Origin: https://<host>:8080` through the tunnel and reading
it off Traefik's access log:

```
direct to Traefik : "request_Origin":"https://<host>:8080"
through the tunnel: "request_Origin":"http://localhost:8080"
```

`Host` breaks the OAuth redirect (you land on `localhost:8080`). `Origin`
breaks the web client's session socket: BC's WebSocket middleware compares
`Origin` against `PublicWebBaseUrl` and answers **403 with an empty body** on
a mismatch, so `/csh` never upgrades and the client sits at "Getting ready…"
forever. Against an authenticated session, every `Origin` value returns 403
except the exact public one, which returns 101.

The `publichost` middleware restores both. Behind a proxy on a real DNS name,
drop it and let `passHostHeader` do its job.

The tunnel also has to allow anonymous access: the relay answers an
unauthenticated GET with a 302 but an unauthenticated POST with a 401, and
Entra's `form_post` callback is a POST.

```bash
devtunnel create bc-web -d "BC Linux web client" -e 30d
devtunnel port create bc-web -p 8080 --protocol http
devtunnel access create bc-web -a
devtunnel host bc-web
```

### Traefik

Opt-in via `--profile traefik`. It terminates the browser connection and opens
a **second TLS connection** to the bc container, so the web client sees `https`
natively rather than inferring it from `X-Forwarded-Proto` — which is what
OAuth redirect URIs and `Secure` cookies key off. That is why
`BC_WEBCLIENT_FORWARDED_HEADERS=0`.

The backend certificate is validated, not skipped: `traefik/dynamic.yml` pins
`rootCAs: /certs/ca.crt` and `serverName: bc` (the compose service name, which
keeps the file free of environment-specific values). Generate a CA and a leaf
whose SAN covers the compose service name, localhost and the public hostname:

```bash
mkdir -p certs && cd certs
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout ca.key -out ca.crt -days 365 \
  -subj "/CN=BC dev CA"
printf 'subjectAltName=DNS:<public host>,DNS:bc,DNS:localhost,IP:127.0.0.1\nextendedKeyUsage=serverAuth\n' > san.cnf
openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout bc.key -out bc.csr -subj "/CN=<public host>"
openssl x509 -req -in bc.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -out bc.crt \
  -days 365 -extfile san.cnf
openssl pkcs12 -export -out bc.pfx -inkey bc.key -in bc.crt -passout pass:<pfx password>
```

`BC_CERT_DIR` (default `../certs`) mounts it into both containers at `/certs`.
Keeping it outside the repo keeps the private keys out of git.

### App registration

Single-tenant, `requestedAccessTokenVersion: 2`, `isFallbackPublicClient: true`,
both implicit-grant boxes on (BC uses `response_type=code id_token` with
`response_mode=form_post`), `identifierUris: ["api://<app id>"]` — a bare
`api://<app id>` with no trailing slash, or Entra rejects it with
`IdentifierUrisEndsWithSlash`, and anything on an unverified domain fails with
`HostNameNotOnVerifiedDomain`. Redirect URIs must list **both** `/SignIn` and
`/OAuthLanding.htm` on the public host.

Delegated permissions: `user_impersonation` and `Financials.ReadWrite.All` on
the BC first-party app `996def3d-b36c-4153-8607-a6fd3c01b89f`, plus the Graph
basics (`openid`, `profile`, `email`, `offline_access`, `User.Read`). If the BC
service principal doesn't exist in the tenant yet, create it before granting
consent. Don't add SharePoint or Power BI permissions unless those service
principals exist in the tenant — admin consent fails for the whole app if any
resource is missing.

The BC API permissions matter only for calling the OData/API endpoints with a
bearer token; **the web client works without them**, so a 401 from
`/api/v2.0/companies` proves nothing about web-client sign-in.

## Architecture

```
browser ──HTTP/WS (/csh, JSON-RPC)──▶ Prod.Client.WebCoreApp (Kestrel, :8080)
                                           │  in the same bc container
                                           ▼
                              ws://localhost:7085 (client services)
                                           │
                                        Linux NST
```

- `scripts/start-webclient.sh` stages the artifact's
  `WebClient/.../WebPublish/` publish layout into `/bc/webclient/` (writable
  copy), patches configs, creates required directories/symlinks, and execs
  `dotnet Prod.Client.WebCoreApp.dll` with the dedicated startup hook.
- `src/WebClientHook/` is a **separate** lightweight `DOTNET_STARTUP_HOOKS`
  assembly. The NST's `StartupHook` is deliberately not reused — it contains
  patches that assume the NST process (encryption provider swaps, side
  services, Cecil compiler fixes).
- The web-server↔NST channel needs nothing new: the NST's client services
  already run over Kestrel on 7085 via the HttpSys stub (exercised daily by
  `run-tests.sh`), and the web client connects to it out of the box with
  `ClientServicesCredentialType=NavUserPassword`.

## What start-webclient.sh configures (and why)

| Change | Why |
|---|---|
| `navsettings.json`: `Server=localhost`, `ServerInstance=BC`, `ClientServicesPort=7085`, `ClientServicesCredentialType=NavUserPassword`, `RequireSsl=false`, `ServerHttps=false`, `AuthenticateServer=false` | Point at the local Linux NST over plain ws:// |
| `Prod.Client.WebCoreApp.runtimeconfig.json`: `System.Globalization.UseNls=false` (+ `DOTNET_SYSTEM_GLOBALIZATION_USENLS=0`) | The shipped config forces NLS globalization, which is Windows-only |
| `hosting.json`: rewrite `urls` to the desired port | The app calls `UseUrls(hosting.json)` which **wins over `ASPNETCORE_URLS`** (shipped value is `http://*:48900`) |
| `mkdir wwwroot/Resources/ExtractedResources`, `Thumbnails`, `Resources/images/static`, `Reports` | Startup check throws `DirectoryNotFoundException` if missing (the Windows MSI creates them) |
| Lowercase symlinks in `wwwroot/js/` (`boot.js` → `Boot.js`, …) | The boot view reads script files by lowercased name; Linux is case-sensitive |
| `wwwroot/Resources/Brand` → `brand` symlink | `BrandProvider` enumerates `Resources/Brand/...`; artifact ships `brand` |
| `wwwroot/Resources/Fonts` → `fonts` symlink | The FluentUI icon-font CSS requests `Resources/Fonts/fluentui/fabric-icons-*.woff`; artifact ships `fonts`. Without it every glyph icon (action bar, chevrons, system tray) 404s and renders blank |
| `DOTNET_TieredCompilation=0` | **Critical.** JMP hooks get silently overwritten by Tier-1 recompilation — same invariant as the NST. Symptom was maddening: the EventLog patch worked at startup, then minutes later the original code came back and the first session-level log write killed the session thread |
| `HTTPSYS_STUB_INJECT_IDENTITY=0` | See stub changes below |
| `DOTNET_STARTUP_HOOKS=/bc/webclient-hook/WebClientHook.dll` | Replaces the NST hook for this process |

## WebClientHook patches

| # | Target | Problem on Linux | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| W1 | `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.EventLog` `EventLogLoggerProvider.CreateLogger` | Web server registers a Windows EventLog logging provider unconditionally; first logger creation throws `PlatformNotSupportedException` inside `WebHostBuilder.Build()` | JMP-hook to return `NullLogger.Instance` |
| W2 | `Microsoft.Dynamics.Framework.UI.WebBase.FilePersistenceManager` (all 5 methods) | Resource/thumbnail persistence builds paths from hardcoded backslash constants (`"Resources\ExtractedResources\"`) | Reimplement with `\`→`/` normalization; everything funnels through this one class |
| W3 | `Microsoft.Dynamics.Nav.Types.EventLogWriter` | The embedded Nav client runtime's background event queue calls `System.Diagnostics.EventLog` and aborts the process | Replace static writer instance with a `DispatchProxy` no-op (same as NST Patch #4; JMP unreliable here due to inlining) |
| W4 | `Microsoft.Dynamics.Framework.UI.Web.FileHelper.GetSymbolicLinkTarget` | P/Invokes kernel32 `CreateFile`/`GetFinalPathNameByHandle` just to resolve symlinks for a `FileSystemWatcher` | Managed reimplementation via `FileInfo.ResolveLinkTarget` |
| W5 | (all assemblies) | Any other Win32 P/Invoke | `ResolvingUnmanagedDll` → `libwin32_stubs.so`, mirroring NST Patch #3 |
| W6 / W6b | `ConfigurationTimeZoneProvider.get_TimeZone`, `TimeZoneHelper.DetectTimeZone` | The browser's time zone is sent to the NST and serialized with `TimeZoneInfo.ToSerializedString`, which fails to deserialize on Linux for DST zones (see Time zone bug below) | Emit a round-trip-safe zone (`Etc/GMT±N` for whole-hour offsets, synthetic `UTC±HH:MM` for sub-hour) instead of an ICU zone |

### The time zone bug (most important fix for real users)

`TimeZoneInfo.FromSerializedString(TimeZoneInfo.X.ToSerializedString())` throws
`InvalidTimeZoneException` on Linux for most ICU zones that carry DST rules — a
.NET-on-Linux quirk. BC round-trips session/user time zones through exactly that
pair, so **any user whose browser is in a DST time zone (Europe, most of the US,
Australia, …) could not sign in** — `OpenConnection` died server-side before the
client loaded. The CRONUS demo DB also ships
`[User Personalization].[Time Zone] = 'Europe/Amsterdam'`, which broke even a
UTC browser on the very first login.

It took three coordinated changes because the zone flows through both processes
and gets **persisted and re-resolved** on each login:

1. **Web client (W6b)** maps the browser's reported offset to a round-trip-safe
   id (`Etc/GMT±N` / synthetic `UTC±HH:MM`) before it's sent to the NST.
2. **NST StartupHook Patch #24** (`NSServiceBase.FindClientTimeZone`,
   `UserSettings.set_TimeZoneInfo`) substitutes a safe zone for any ICU zone that
   doesn't survive the round-trip, so the server can't crash on a zone the client
   sends or one already stored in personalization.
3. **Entrypoint** normalizes the demo DB's `[User Personalization].[Time Zone]`
   to `UTC` *before* NST starts (so its data cache is clean from boot — a SQL
   `UPDATE` after NST is running is masked by the cache).

Why those specific ids: `Etc/GMT±N` are real IANA zones with no DST, so they
both serialize cleanly *and* re-resolve to a safe zone when BC writes the id back
to personalization and reads it next login. Sub-hour offsets (India +5:30, Tehran
+3:30) have no Etc equivalent, so they use a synthetic `UTC±HH:MM` id that
`TryFindSystemTimeZoneById` skips (leaving the zone unset = safe) while still
round-tripping as a custom zone for the live session. Trade-off: server-side date
math uses a fixed offset rather than DST rules for affected zones (off by an hour
only across a DST transition) — acceptable for a dev/CI container.

Verified by logging in with the browser forced to Europe/Berlin, America/New_York,
Australia/Sydney (DST), Asia/Kolkata (+5:30), Asia/Tehran (+3:30) and UTC — each
twice, to exercise the persist-then-re-resolve cycle — with zero
`InvalidTimeZoneException` server-side.

Debug aid: `WEBCLIENT_DEBUG_FIRSTCHANCE=1` prints every thrown exception with
full inner chain to stderr — the web client ships no console logging
provider, so without this, mid-response failures (e.g. during Razor view
streaming) are completely invisible.

## Shared stub changes (affect the NST image — reviewed for safety)

- **HttpSysStub** (`src/stubs/HttpSysStub/HttpSysStub.cs`): the
  inject-admin-identity middleware is now gated behind
  `HTTPSYS_STUB_INJECT_IDENTITY != "0"`. Default behavior is unchanged (NST
  still gets the injected identity); the web client process sets `0` because
  a pre-authenticated principal bypasses its forms sign-in page entirely
  (symptom: `/` skipped `/SignIn` and went straight to a broken client shell).
- **WindowsPrincipalStub** (`src/stubs/WindowsPrincipalStub/`): added
  `WindowsIdentity.AccessToken` returning an invalid
  `SafeAccessTokenHandle`. The web client's `LogicalThread` captures
  `GetCurrent().AccessToken` and re-impersonates it on session threads via
  `RunImpersonated` (which the stub runs without impersonation). Without it,
  every session thread died with `MissingMethodException` and `OpenSession`
  over `/csh` never got an answer. Purely additive.

## Notable non-obvious findings

- The publish layout is `WebClient/PFiles/Microsoft Dynamics NAV/<ver>/Web
  Client/WebPublish/` and is a **win-x64 RID-specific** publish — but every
  assembly that matters is IL, so `dotnet Prod.Client.WebCoreApp.dll` runs
  fine on Linux (win-x64 R2R prejit is ignored; methods JIT from IL, which
  is also why JMP hooks work on them).
- The app self-hosts via `UseHttpSys` — the repo's existing HttpSys→Kestrel
  stub (shared-framework replacement) covers it with zero extra work.
- `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development` is a trap: the boot view then tries
  to inline `js/boot.debug.js`, which Microsoft doesn't ship in the
  artifact. Run Production (default).
- The browser UI loads the SPA in an iframe (`?runinframe=1`) — relevant for
  Playwright selectors, not for functionality.
- The NST side needed **zero** changes: NavUserPassword auth, session
  creation, metadata, and data all flow through the same 7085 channel the
  test runner uses.

## Additionally verified (dev-tool bar)

The intended audience is developers spinning up a container on Linux/macOS
to do basic testing through the web client. Verified beyond the milestones:

- **Writes round-trip.** Editing a field on the Customer Card
  (`?page=21&mode=Edit`), tabbing out, reloading in a fresh session: the
  value persisted through the NST into SQL. Reverted afterwards.
- **Direct URL navigation** works: `/?page=22` (list), `/?page=21`,
  `&mode=Edit` — the navigation style devs actually use.
- **Crash recovery.** The entrypoint supervises the process with a simple
  restart loop; `kill -9` on the web client brought it back automatically
  within seconds (`[entrypoint] web client exited (rc=137) — restarting`).
- **Container restart** re-stages nothing (staged copy persists in the
  container's writable layer) and the web client comes back on its own.
- **macOS**: the `docker-compose.macos.yml` overlay only adjusts SQL; the
  web client inherits the same config and port mapping, so
  `BC_WEBCLIENT=1 docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.macos.yml up -d --wait`
  is expected to work identically under Rosetta (same linux/amd64 image as
  the NST; not separately exercised on Apple hardware).

Note the web client comes up ~20–40s *after* the container reports healthy
(the healthcheck gates only the NST, intentionally) — if `:8080` refuses
connections right after `--wait` returns, give it a moment.

## Known gaps / not validated

- **AL debugger launch mode (F5) session binding is unreliable.** Opening a
  URL with the `debuggingcontext` query parameter (what F5 generates) forces
  a re-sign-in, and the web client's session creation then usually dies in
  `ConnectionEstablisher.OpenWebSocket → PromptForCredentials()` with
  `NavCancelCredentialPromptException` (logged in `/tmp/webclient.log`), drops
  the debug parameters, and lands on the role center without binding the
  debugger. The full cycle (bind → break → stack → variables) was observed
  working once, so the NST side is fine — the gap is in the web client's
  credential flow for debug-bound sessions. Attach mode (`breakOnNext`) is
  unaffected and fully working; see `docs/DEBUGGING.md`.
- **Record images (Customer/Item/Contact pictures, user avatars) don't
  render.** The picture control requests
  `/img?sessionid=...&ts=<mediaGuid>_360x0.` and gets a 404; the
  `Thumbnails` cache directory stays empty. The serving path
  (`WebImageHelper.TryLoadMediaThumbnail` →
  `LogicalMediaProvider.ProvideMediaThumbnail` →
  `mediaProvider.LoadMediaThumbnail`, then
  `WebImageHelper.TryGetWebCompatibleImage`) uses **System.Drawing.Common**
  (`ImageControl.TryLoadImage`, `Image.FromStream`), which throws
  `PlatformNotSupportedException` unconditionally on Linux in .NET 8 —
  the web client ships the real Windows-only package. A likely fix is a
  WebClientHook patch that replaces `TryGetWebCompatibleImage` /
  `TryLoadImage` with magic-byte content-type sniffing (no actual GDI
  decode is needed just to serve the bytes), but this is not done yet.
  Static images (action icons, placeholders, brand assets) are unaffected.
- `GET /splashCheck` 404s (harmless; splash screen still renders).
- A stray literal-backslash directory (`wwwroot/Reports\`) appears at
  startup — some path producer outside `FilePersistenceManager` still uses
  backslashes. Cosmetic so far; report preview/download is untested and
  would be the first place to look (likely needs a W2-style hook on its
  persistence path).
- Untested surface: reports/printing, file upload/download, designer,
  multi-user/multi-session behavior, Teams/Office add-in hosts.
- `Resources\ExtractedResources` extraction (tenant media etc.) works via
  the W2 hook but has only been exercised lightly.

These are acceptable for the stated goal (basic dev testing through the
UI). If one of them starts to matter, the fix pattern is almost always
another instance of W1–W5: find the throwing call with
`WEBCLIENT_DEBUG_FIRSTCHANCE=1`, then either a JMP hook, a backslash
normalization, or a case-fix symlink.
