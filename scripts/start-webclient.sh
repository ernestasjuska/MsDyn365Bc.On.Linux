# on Kestrel inside the bc container, pointed at the Linux NST.
#
# EXPERIMENTAL / PoC — see docs/WEBCLIENT-POC.md.
#
# Usage (inside the bc container):
#   /bc/scripts/start-webclient.sh [port]
# Or from the host:
#   docker compose exec bc /bc/scripts/start-webclient.sh
#
# Opt-in from docker compose: set BC_WEBCLIENT=1 (entrypoint starts it in the
# background after the NST is ready) and map port 8080.

# Optional path-prefix support for reverse proxies that route by path
# (single hostname/port, e.g. https://host:port/my-tier) rather than by
# hostname or port. HttpSysStub's UrlStrippingStartupFilter already strips
# a path component off the server address and calls UsePathBase() with it
# (see src/stubs/HttpSysStub/HttpSysStub.cs) — this just gives that a
# documented, first-class way in from docker compose. Normalize to a
# leading slash / no trailing slash; HttpSysStub trims a trailing slash
# itself, but the leading slash is required for Uri.AbsolutePath parsing.

# Optional: tell the web client it is reached over HTTPS even though it speaks
# plain HTTP itself. Needed when TLS is terminated by a reverse proxy in front
# of the container: without it the client builds its redirects from its own
# scheme and emits "Location: http://<public-host>/SignIn", which the browser
# then follows in cleartext against a TLS-only port. Also makes BC mark its
# session cookies Secure. Off by default (direct http://localhost access).
# Serve TLS from Kestrel instead of plain HTTP. Set this when a proxy in front of
# the container re-terminates TLS rather than forwarding cleartext: the app then
# sees the real scheme natively and needs no X-Forwarded-Proto interpretation,
# which is what makes OAuth redirect URIs and Secure cookies come out right.
