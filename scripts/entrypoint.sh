# Nav.Server.dll exist", which is true for any previous version's leftovers,

# silently kept the old, differently-patched tier. That's why CLAUDE.md tells
# you to run `docker compose down -v` after editing the hook; with the stamp
# the rebuild is automatic and that step is no longer a footgun.
#
# The image half of the key is StartupHook.dll's size+mtime: docker gives every

# Service user for scripting/OData/dev endpoint/web client sign-in (SUPER access).
# Username defaults to BCRUNNER (not ADMIN) so tests can freely create/delete/disable
# an "ADMIN" user; override via BC_SERVER_USERNAME/BC_SERVER_PASSWORD (docker-compose.yml
# passes these through — see the comment there). GUID 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001.
#
# [User].[Expiry Date] MUST be '1753-01-01' (BC's "never expires" sentinel/NavDateTime.Undefined),
# NOT a real future date like '2099-12-31' -- confirmed by decompiling
# SystemTableTriggers.CheckForExistenceOfSuperUserIfNecessaryAsync (Nav.Ncl.dll): its
# GenerateSuperUserAuthenticationMethodQuery join filters candidate SUPER users to
# expiryDateField.Equal(NavDateTime.Undefined), so a real Expiry Date -- even one far in the
# future and clearly intended to mean "does not expire" -- silently excludes the user from
# that query, making CheckSuperUserAuthenticationMethodQueryAsync see zero qualifying rows and
# throw "You must assign at least one user the SUPER permission set...". This fires on ANY
# operation that commits a transaction while requiring a live SUPER user check -- reproduced
# via extension installs (e.g. publishing Continia OPplus), not something specific to that app.
# 2099-12-31 was previously used here on the mistaken assumption that BC just wants "a date far
# enough in the future"; the platform's own convention (see [User Property].[WebServices Key
# Expiry Date] two lines below, which already correctly used 1753-01-01) says otherwise.
#
# The stored password hash is a fixed placeholder, NOT a hash of BC_SERVER_PASSWORD —
# NavUser.TryAuthenticate's hash check doesn't verify on Linux (the Windows hash format
# doesn't port; StartupHook Patch #16b bypasses verification and always returns true),
# so whatever the DB row holds is never compared against what the client sends. Any
# password authenticates as this user once it exists with SUPER access; the [Password]
# column only needs to be non-empty for the platform to treat the account as
# NavUserPassword-eligible. That means BC_SERVER_PASSWORD is honored end-to-end (that
# value really does work at every login surface) without needing to reproduce BC's
# hash algorithm, which isn't documented anywhere outside the platform binaries.
# The helper reads the password from stdin and creates Microsoft's V3 representation;
# plaintext is never passed on argv, written to SQL, or logged.
